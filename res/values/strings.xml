    <string name="app_name">LocationPrivacy</string>
    <string name="app_description">LocationPrivacy is not really app but rather a set of "Intent Filters" for all of the various ways of sharing location.  When you share location from one app, LocationPrivacy offers itself as an option.  It then recognizes insecure methods of sharing location, and then converts them to more secure methods. This mostly means that it rewrites URLs to use https, and even to use `geo:` URIs, which can work on fully offline setups.  LocationPrivacy mostly works by reading the location information from the URL itself.  For many URLs, LocationPrivacy must actually load some of the webpage in order to get the location.</string>
    <string name="usage">To use this app, click on a location link and choose LocationPrivacy, or share some text to LocationPrivacy.  First select LocationPrivacy, it will process the info, then prompt you again with a new list of apps that accept the more private location URL. Click below for an example:</string>
